      I am an undergraduate student. I will try my best to make sure my essays are as reliable as possible, but if you think I'm wrong about something, there's a high chance that you may be right. I've made a feedback page; please shoot me a message if you think that is the case. I may not have the chance to address it right away, so I will highlight regions that others have flagged so that reader may read with caution. <br>
      <br>

      There will be occasional notes in blue. <br>
      <span style="color: blue;">aside</span>s discuss related things that I had found confusing and/or interesting. They may assume knowledge that I have not listed at the beginning of the essay, but I don't list them there because they are not essential to the content of the essay.<br>
      <span style="color: blue;">q</span>s are follow-up questions I still have. <br>
      <span style="color: blue;">todo</span>s are topics I need to do to make the essay more comprehensive. When I publish an essay I do so because they are able to stand alone, but there may be discussion that I would want to add in the future to make them more comprehensive.
