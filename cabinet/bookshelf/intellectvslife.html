    <b>intellectualizing vs life-living, also on art's valueâ€”</b><br>
     I always have a tendency to want to intellectualize or analyze things, in the hope that it will reveal something insightful and meaningful. But I also think that one should be careful not to get too lost in thought. I don't think you can really say anything meaningful about the human condition if you spend all of your time in intellectualizing, because you are not living the human condition yourself. It's foreign to you and so you really have no authority to stand upon.<br>
    <br>
    Maybe there are some advantages to being a total observer of humanity. You can realize things that people caught up in being human wouldn't. But all you can say then is that it seems like xyz is the case, or it appears as though xyz is the case. You can't say with authority that xyz is the case. <br>
    <br>
    I think there are certainly truths that reason and analysis can never capture, which can only be come to through living. I was petting my cat earlier and she was petting me with her tail back, and I just felt this deep, really moving care for her. Does that make sense, as in is there a really good explanation for what that is and why I experience it? She really does nothing other than be cute. I guess I can think of many. I'm sure there's some evolutionary reason for cuteness. Or I project my xyz unconscious insecurities onto the cat so I care for it as I would care for myself. <br>
    <br>
    I don't think I'm trying to deny these explanations any credit at all. Probably I would be really into one or many of them once I'm out of this funk. But every time my mind goes into the realm of thinking about the experience, I really feel as though it's unable to capture a big, big part of the truth and quality of what just happened there. The intellectualizing, I think, really misses something that is just there.<br>
    <br>
    If you're thinking, wtf is this just-thereness that you speak of, you can't just say something is just there without describing it???? Then you ask a good question. Berkeley, for example, was adamant that something which has no describable properties cannot exist to us. And that's why I'm having a hard time writing this, wiffle-waffling and such. I just feel like I have enough evidence in people's love of music, art, poetry, relationships, dancing, and other things of pure experience. If you are asking the above question I ask of you to think of a time where you felt deeply moved by something and at the same time that you heard some explanation of it that truly captured the essence, the entire aspect of what you felt. <br>
    <br>
    So I guess my tentative claim is that I think that there are certain truths that intellectualizing will never be able to get at. Whether objective truths or truths within the human experience, I don't find it matters. One is not more valuable than the other here. I actually think it might be a bit dangerous to worship at the altar of intellect like that. <br>
    <br>
    And I think this is the value of the arts. They do their best to capture this ineffable quality which I don't think can be captured in our normal ways of communication. Once I was talking to my friend about some art we saw. If art has a meaning, then there can be an interpretation and a misinterpretation of it. And if art isn't clear about it's meaning, it's suceptible to misinterpretation. So whatever interperation I gave of art, how do I know it is the right interpretation? I was sort of at a loss, trying to explain my belief in this ineffable quality, which, by being ineffable is unexplainable, and without sounding like a pretentious critic. I think I'm self-aware enough to know when I'm being pretentious, but trying to get at this frustrating little thing is something I'm very earnest about, and which I don't think is pretentious in nature, but very commonplace, so for this I was afraid of coming off as pretentious. <br>
    <br>
    I guess the flow of the argument is something like this. I think there is form of truth that is accessed only through living life, and which cannot be accessed through analysis, straight description, or reason. We can try and analyze what care, love, ecstasy, and despair are but there is always an aspect of it which will elude. The best way to access this truth is through living life, but then you can't really communicate it to the homies. This is where the arts come in. It accesses this truth not by trying to explain it, but treat it as honestly as possible, which is why art is vague and mysterious and abstracted. The arts' lack of clarity is its virture. <br>
    <br>
    Objector: Well hold up. You're intellectualizing about this thing "ineffable quality" right now. And you're claiming to capture it in some way, but you just said intellectualizing can never capture it truly. <br>
    <br>
    Idk man. Maybe you're right and you've caught me in a corner, or maybe it's fine that I did that and there's more nuance that I could argue about, but I'm not feeling the meta stuff right now.
