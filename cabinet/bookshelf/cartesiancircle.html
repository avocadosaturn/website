    <b>descartes' natural light</b><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <u>I. Introduction</u><br>
    In this paper, I show that Descartes can be defended against the Cartesian circle objection. I argue that the concern about clear and distinct perception that leads to the Cartesian circle, namely that an evil deceiver could deceive us that we see something clearly and distinctly, is an ill-conceived concern. This is because it is a retrospective meta-doubt, in that we are asking whether we are certain that we are certain, and in that this doubt occurs after the clear and distinct perception. The former leads to an infinite regress of doubt, while the latter implies that the power of a clear and distinct perception can fade, and this is why we can doubt it in the first place. Furthermore, even if this concern were valid, Descartes is still allowed to use the natural light to conclude that the existence of God is certain, from which it follows that the natural light is reliable, since God does not deceive. I then argue that certain knowledge is the best that can be done by finite thinking things, and that demanding that the natural light reveal objective truth is an unsound demand. <br>

    <br>
    <br>

    <u>II. Descartes' Argument </u><br>
    In Meditations on First Philosophy, Descartes subjects his edifice of received knowledge to extreme skepticism, so as to erode away all fallible knowledge, and in this way learn the nature of the foundations upon which the edifice is built. His method of erosion is the evil deceiver test: given something he had previously taken to be true, if he is able to conceive that an evil deceiver could have deceived him about its truth, then it fails the evil deceiver test and is deemed fallible. Upon reaching incontrovertible knowledge, or “ground floor knowledge,” by this negative method, he can then determine the positive means by which it is supported, i.e., the foundations of the edifice. This allows Descartes to reconstruct the edifice in such a way that follows only from this foundation, and not from any other imperfect means (e.g., the senses).<br>
    From the outset, he is careful not to frame his goal as the recovery of truth, but rather to “hold back [his] assent from opinions which are not completely certain and dubitable,” out of concern for the blind way in which he had accepted knowledge in the past. In particular, he makes no claims that what remains after the edifice of knowledge is subjected to extreme skepticism is that which is objectively true, but rather knowledge that irresistibly draws his assent.
    Descartes concludes that the only knowledge that survives the evil deceiver test is the cogito, which is that “I exist as a thinking thing at the moment that I think it.” When Descartes first explains the cogito to the reader, it seems to be by way of syllogism, in this way: if I am convinced I exist, then there is nothing to prove. On the other hand, if I think I am being deceived that I exist, then there is nonetheless an “I” which is being deceived, from which it follows that I exist as a thinking thing at the moment that I think it. This presentation is potentially problematic because, by appearances, it is a semantic claim, or at the very least a claim that depends on the laws of logic, and the laws of logic could easily be scrambled by an evil deceiver the same way the laws of mathematics could be. Descartes clarifies in his replies that “when someone says ‘I am thinking, therefore I am, or I exist’, he does not deduce existence from thought by means of a syllogism, but recognizes it as something self-evident by a simple intuition of the mind.” Thus while the explanation of the cogito appears syllogistic, this is only because Descartes must capture it in writing to render it communicable. It is not deduced knowledge, but knowledge that, in the very act of thought, one cannot help but assent to.<br>
    In the cogito Descartes has found ground level knowledge, whose stability is incontestable. The irresistible pull of the cogito has its force by way of intuition, or the natural light of reason, which is the foundation for the edifice of knowledge. He calls knowledge illuminated by reason that which is seen “clearly and distinctly.” Anything that is clearly and distinctly perceived, even if it previously failed the evil deceiver test, can now be redeemed as valid knowledge. <br>

    <br>
    <br>

    <u>III. The Cartesian Circle</u><br>
    However, while the cogito survives the evil deceiver test, clear and distinct perception, or certainty, does not. Certainty is but a subjective internal state, and it could be easily conceived that whenever I consider the cogito, I am actually sad, and the evil deceiver swaps my internal state such that I am certain. Furthermore, if logic is defunct, why could it not be the case that intuition is too? If this is the case, whatever means that actually supports the cogito is obscured to us. Descartes is aware of this concern, which he addresses by constructing a proof of the existence of God. Then, since God exists and God is good, there is no deception to be concerned about.<br>
    There are two issues here. Firstly, Descartes only proves that God exists as the formally real cause of the idea of God in our minds, but does not justify why an infinitely good God would not deceive. Secondly, the premises for the proof of God’s existence are justified by way of the natural light, and the original concern was that the natural light might itself be fallible. Because the premises do not directly utilize the natural light, but rather the justifications of the premises, this could be circumvented by justifying them via some other means. But because Descartes has shown that other means of attaining knowledge are not reliable, this is not a tenable option for him. Thus if the only possible way for Descartes to justify premises at this point is the natural light, and yet the natural light itself does not pass the evil deceiver test, then his proof of God cannot hold and no knowledge can be redeemed at all.<br>

    <u>IV. Variability of Perception Across Minds</u><br>
    IV. Defenses Against the Cartesian Circle
    There are two types of defenses that I will make. One type of defense will defend the use of the natural light, while another type of defense contends that doubt of the natural light is ill-conceived.<br>
    <br>

    Type I — Throes of Cognition Defense<br>
    The evil deceiver test only invalidates the use of natural light in a very specific sense. For, all that is being said when something is revealed by the natural light is that, in the throes of cognition, we cannot help but be certain of it. That is, in our immediate confrontation of it, it draws our assent to it against our will. That the natural light fails the evil deceiver test means that it is uncertain whether or not we should trust that which we cannot help but be certain of, not that it is uncertain whether or not we cannot help but be certain of it in the first place. Therefore if all Descartes wishes to say is that we cannot help but be certain of the premises of the proof of God, then there is nothing yet inconsistent. Whether or not the premises actually solicit our assent can still be debated, and this is the question that must be asked to invalidate the statement of the premises.<br>
    <br>

    Type II — Ill-Conceived Doubt Defenses<br>
    The act of doubting the natural light has two properties of interest which Descartes can use to defend against the Cartesian circle.<br>
    <br>
    Property 1: It is done at a meta-level of thought.<br>
    Property 2: It is done retrospectively.<br>
    <br>
    Property 1 says that doubting the natural light is, in essence, asking whether we can be certain that we are certain. In other words, in order to establish level 1 certainty (that we are certain about something), we must establish level 2 certainty (that we are certain that we are certain about something). But in order to establish level 2 certainty, we must establish level 3 certainty, and so on, which leads to an infinite regress. This is an intractable problem, but it is unclear whether this is a issue for Descartes or for the objector. On the one hand, Descartes’ system has a problem which is unsolvable; on the other hand, the problem is not well-formed. However, there are other ways in which doubt of the natural light is ill-conceived. <br>
    Property 2 says that when one doubts their clear and distinct perception of something, it appears that this is an act done retrospectively to the actual clear and distinct perception. Descartes can argue that it is unfair to doubt the natural light retrospectively, because at the moment of doubting, you are no longer confronted with the object, and so you can not feel the full force of a clear and distinct perception. It fades to a weaker version of what it once was, remaining only as a memory, and this is precisely what allows you to doubt in the first place. If it is the case that, regardless of retrospective meta-doubt, one cannot help but see something as clear and distinct when confronted with it once again, then the ability to doubt the natural light does not indicate a fault in the natural light, but is rather an effect of our inability to think across many meta-levels of thought simultaneously. For example, if we could confront knowledge that is immediately before us at the same time that we could consider ourselves confronting that piece of knowledge—i.e., if doubt of the certainty of something were not retrospective to, but contiguous with, the certainty of something—then this would be a serious objection to the use of the natural light. But, if this is not the case, as Descartes claims, then the problem is with memory and not with the natural light. <br>
    A potential problem with this defense is that Descartes should not invalidate retrospective examination of that which is clear and distinct, because this is precisely what is being done with the original application of the evil deceiver test to received knowledge. For example, one could argue that 2 + 3 = 5, or that the computer I am writing on exists, is clearly and distinctly perceived in the throes of cognition, and that, by Descartes’ argument, it is invalid to doubt this, too. Here, Descartes can fall back on the infinite regress defense, and say that the problem comes in doubting that we are certain that we are certain about something, and that it is fine to doubt that we are certain about something. Furthermore, this may not actually be a problem in the first place, even if the infinite regress defense is unsatisfactory. After all, Descartes’ ultimate goal is to recover that 2 + 3 = 5 and that the computer I am typing on exists. The “problem” contends that, while we can doubt matter and math, it is invalid to do so—but this actually coalesces with Descartes’ argument, albeit via a different route.<br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <u>V. Certainty vs. Truth</u><br>
    Let us return to the “throes of cognition defense,” and suppose that we accept it. This defense has shown that Descartes is allowed to use the natural light in his proof of God. Now, the natural light is meant to drag us against our will through the proof of God, to the conclusion that it is certain that God exists. However, the defense has not shown that we can trust certainty as a source of knowledge. While the idea is that, since God does not deceive, the existence of God will make it so that we cannot doubt the validity of certainty, another objection that can be brought up at this point is that the fact that it is certain God exists does not say anything about the objective truth of God’s existence. And we need the objective existence of God to recover the natural light; the subjective inability to doubt the existence of God is not strong enough. For it is conceivable that one could be certain that God exists while it actually being the case that God does not exist. Then, can reason even be a valid foundation for knowledge?<br>
    I think Descartes' best response to this objection is exasperation. What better can we do as a foundation for truth, if we are necessarily limited by the confines of the mind? Recall that in Section II I made the point that it does not appear to be Descartes’ goal to establish objective knowledge, but rather infallible knowledge. And insofar as the vast majority of the content of our lives is interactions with other finite minds, knowledge that is infallible to limited thinking things is not an unreasonable foundation for truth within the system of human society. Furthermore, it seems too much to ask for objective knowledge about omniscience, because the concept of omniscience stems in the first place from our inability as finite creatures to obtain it. Therefore, the objector either believes that any faculty of the mind is entirely unable to access objective knowledge about omniscience, in which case they should not be demanding it of Descartes, or they believe that our mental faculties can get hazy impressions of it. If they think that reason can do this, then there is no reason to object in this manner. If they think that reason cannot but other faculties can (e.g., faith, ego death, etc), then it is incumbent on the objector to justify how this faculty does better.<br>
