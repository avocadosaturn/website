              <br>

              I found Mallarmé very difficult to understand, and had to re-read stanzas many many times to even grasp their concept. He has, 
              to the point where it becomes abrasive, a dedication to the effect over the object. This is perhaps not a particularly exciting trait given where we are at 
              our point in history several phases past the onset of modernism, but he makes all the trailing and fading about the object uniquely rigid in the 
              straitjacket of his form, which is semi-classical; that, with his preoccupation with something like the Platonic Ideal, gave to me something entirely different
              than the psychological and subjective effect of "typical" modernism, as far as there is such a thing. The introduction to the collection I was reading talks 
              of how his writing is particularly musical—maybe… maybe in some composerly or baroque way (I shy away from associating him with the 
              lushness of Debussy, with whom he is often compared to, or just melodiousness in general)—but more than that, even when the content is dreamy and luminous 
              and the flute literally makes the air thick, I think, rather, that his writing maintains something of the austerity of a textile. <br>

              This virginal long-living lovely day <br>
              will it tear from us with a wing's wild blow <br>
              the lost hard lake haunted beneath the snow <br>
              by clear ice-flights that never flew away! <br>
              <br>
              A swan of old remembers it is he <br>
              superb but strives to break free woebegone <br>
              for having left unsung the territory <br>
              to live when sterile winter's tedium shone <br>
              <br>
              His neck will shake off this white throe that space<br>
              has forced the bird denying it to face, <br>
              but not the horror of Earth that traps its wings. <br>
