      <b>sublimity and objectivity in nature</b><br>
      2/3/25<br>
      <br>
      <br>

        <b>Abstract.</b> Physicists often provide accounts of a strong aesthetic experience associated with the development of theories. While most literature has focused on how physicists’ aesthetic experiences are founded in pleasurably beautiful theories, I instead provide an account of the role of the sublime in physics, which points to mathematics as a system of pure objectivity. I then explore whether the belief in mathematics as objective is justified, and thus whether the sublime in physics is a deceptive sensory experience, or if it actually substantiates objectivity. <br>
        <br> 

        <b>The Mathematical Universe as Sublime</b><br>
        The sublime is a category in aesthetic philosophy which encompasses all that has the property of greatness beyond fathoming. The sublime, in being uniquely super-human (in the sense of beyond human), is said to induce a particularly powerful aesthetic experience, characterized by feelings such as awe, terror, and exaltation. Kant describes the experience of the sublime as that of a conflict between the natural (in the dual sense of the external natural world and our natural capabilities) inducing feelings of displeasure, and one's reason inducing feelings of pleasure. He differentiates between the dynamical sublime, or that which overwhelms with its power, and the mathematical sublime, or that which overwhelms with its magnitude. <br>
        <br>
        An example of an experience of the dynamical sublime would be the experience of being at home in a terrible storm and looking out the window, knowing your safety even as you know the storm should be tearing you apart. The displeasure stems from the existential threat that the super-human power of the natural world poses, while the pleasure stems from reason assuring you of your vantage point of safety. A classic example of the mathematical sublime would be the cosmos, which is unknowable to our natural senses on account of its immense magnitude, but which nonetheless can be grasped rationally, as evidenced by the field of cosmology. <br>

        <br>
        From here, it is not such a large jump to see how the project of physics in general is closely married to the mathematical sublime. The physical realm, which, in addition to appearing immeasurably vast to our natural senses, also appears wild and ungovernable, in physics is able to be accessed and contained by way of mathematics. This has allowed us to breach into realms which are materially inaccessible, such as the unfathomably fundamental realm of quantum mechanics to the unfathomably fast realm of special relativity. Now to be clear, the implication here is not that anyone who practices physics should then constantly be having the sublime experience. Rather, my claim is that the fact that physics works in the first place—that is, that the union of the natural realm and mathematics is at all possible—is mathematically sublime in the particular way that Kant describes mathematical sublimity. The astonishing nature of the fact that the universe, at least as far as we know it thus far, operates as a mathematical entity, is explained in Eugene Wigner's paper “The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in Physics”: <br>
        <br>
        <i>It is, as Schrodinger has remarked, a miracle that in spite of the baffling complexity of the world, certain regularities in the events could be discovered... We are so used to the concept of natural laws, that we forget that “it is not at all natural that 'laws of nature' exist, much less that man is able to discover them.”</i> <br>
        <br>
        While Kant describes the aesthetic pleasure of the mathematical sublime as being a somewhat self-centered one, which rests on a rational capacity that is internal and entirely one’s own, in the case of the mathematical universe as sublime, it is rather mathematics which is the source of aesthetic pleasure. For, as Wigner points out, it is not really the physicist who grasps the physical world, but mathematics which has already grasped it—the physicist merely finds the natural law that was already there. The apparently external nature of mathematics gives it its characteristic "cold beauty": <br>
        <br>
        <i>Mathematics, rightly viewed, possess not only truth, but supreme beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show.</i><br>
        <br>
        Therefore, in mathematics we appear to have stumbled upon something external to humanity that is both eternal and objective. For surely the universe operated by natural law long before humanity developed, and would continue to do so if we were gone. Continued research in physics, in fact, must stem from the conviction that mathematics will continue to describe the areas of the physical we do not yet know. Kant and Schopenhauer, the two philosophers who have written most extensively on the sublime, believed the sublime experience substantiated something objective. But the abstractness of their respective theories about the realms of objectivity make it difficult to scrutinize the claimed objectivity. Thus the sublime experience described above is important because it points to mathematics as the objective realm, the objectivity of which is much more feasible to analyze. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>The Objectivity of Mathematics</b> <br>
        The sublime experience that many physicists and mathematicians seem to derive from the applicability of mathematics to the physical suggests an instinctive belief in the objectivity of mathematics. But is mathematics truly so pure? Following Øystein Linnebo in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry “Platonism in the Philosophy of Mathematics,” henceforth I capitalize terms that are meant in a technical sense over their colloquial meanings. The following discussion is loosely based on the structure of argument in Linnebo’s article. There are two claims one could make to point to the objectivity of mathematics:  <br>
        <br>
        1. <u>Objective Existence:</u> mathematical objects are non-spatiotemporal and exist independently of consciousness. 
        <br>
        2. <u>Objective Truth:</u> statements of mathematics have truth-values, independently of whether consciousness has access to them. <br>
        <br>

        It must be emphasized that Objective Existence and Objective Truth are claims about the nature of two different things within the realm of mathematics: Objective Existence is concerned with the nature of mathematical objects, while Truth is concerned about the nature of mathematical statements. A mathematical object on its own, e.g., the number 3, can not be true or false; similarly, a mathematical statement contains a lexical relationship between objects, and can not be said to exist (or at least, we do not really care whether or not it does in the same way we do about mathematical objects). One might say to choose whichever is more fundamental—mathematical objects or mathematical statements—and argue for the objectivity of that in order to establish the objectivity of mathematics in general. For example, one could argue that because mathematical statements are made up of mathematical objects, mathematical objects are the more fundamental, and so their Objective Existence should have implications for the Objective Truth of statements describing them. But it is not quite so simple. It turns out that  <br>
        $$ \text{Objective Existence} \not \implies \ \text{Objective Truth.} $$ 
        For example, suppose that the natural numbers have Objective Existence. This does not necessarily mean we have unfettered access to these objects and their properties. Whatever faculty we use to access mathematical objects—call it rationality or intelligence, but certainly a faculty different from the way our sensory faculties access physical objects—it is possible it is only able to have knowledge about a shadow of the mathematical object, in the manner of Plato's Cave. Furthermore, the way in which we make claims about these objects are necessarily bound by semantics in a way that the objects in themselves are not. All mathematical statements are mediated through semantics; if one believes that language is unable to adequately capture abstract objects, then one is justified in saying that the Objective Existence of mathematical objects does not imply that mathematical statements have Objective Truth. Similarly,<br>
        $$ \text{Objective Truth} \not \implies \text{Objective Existence.} $$ 
        Consider the statement “seven is odd,” and suppose that it has an objective truth value—it is either case that seven is odd or it is not. Now let us suppose that it is true. Formally this means that,  <br>
        $$ \not \exists n \in \Z \ s.t. \ 7/2 = 2n. $$
        While the truth of this statement suggests that 2, 7, and the natural numbers exist as mental concepts, one can still deny that their existence is independent of consciousness. For example, suppose there are two pears on the table—one could say that unless something with a desire to describe the world encounters the pears, there is no "twoness" in the setup at all. In short, Objective Truth does not imply anything about whether or not mathematical objects depend on an agent. However, the two are not completely unrelated. Objective Existence with other premises can imply Objective Truth, and Objective Truth with other premises can imply Objective Existence. Here, I will take the latter route, for two reasons. Firstly, it feels like we care more about Objective Truth than Objective Existence, this being a purely descriptive claim. The Objective Existence of mathematical objects are only substantial insofar as there are consequences. Suppose the number one has Objective Existence. All this tells us that it is “out there,” independent of us. On the other hand, the truth of the statement 1 + 1 = 2 is much more consequential to our operations as human beings, and, I think, of more immediate epistemic value. Secondly, this route is more akin to the way mathematics actually develops. It seems fair to say that the project of mathematics is not that mathematicians access all the properties of objects in some abstract realm and then set about recording their findings, but that they start from a belief about what should be mathematical theorems. The point is that I have chosen this route of this justification because it seems to me more familiar to the everyday experience with mathematics, but this is not the only way of justifying Objective Existence and/or Objective Truth. Thus I will start by assuming the Objective Truth, and show what else must be accepted in order to get to Objective Existence. Then I will scrutinize the assumption of Objective Truth and its tenability. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Justifying Objective Existence Given Objective Truth</b><br>
        The first step to justifying Objective Existence, more commonly known as mathematical platonism, requires firstly justifying the acceptance of <br>
        <br>
        <u>Existence:</u> mathematical objects exist, in the sense that we are justified in using the quantifier $\exists$. <br>
        <br> 
        Consider again the statement 1 + 1 = 2. Since we are supposing Objective Truth, as long as one accepts classical semantics, as most who are not working in fringe mathematics would tend to, then 1 and 2 must exist in some form, in the sense that there exists a 1 and a 2 such that 1 + 1 = 2 (see the Fregean argument for a more rigorously explanation). The moment we acknowledge the existence of an object, we must also acknowledge that it has properties. Platonists would require that mathematical objects have <br>
        <br>
        <u>Abstractness:</u> the quality of being non-spatiotemporal. <br>
        <br>
        The Abstractness of mathematical objects is not a particularly controversial claim, "for if these objects had spatiotemporal locations…pure mathematicians ought then to take an interest in the locations of their objects, just as zoologists take an interest in the locations of animals." However, Abstractness still makes space for mathematical objects to be mental constructs, and thus to have a causal relation to the existence of consciousness—in particular, humans as spatiotemporal objects. Thus Platonists would also require that mathematical objects have <br>
        <br>
        <u>Independence</u>: the quality of not having a causal relation to human consciousness. <br>
        <br>
        Thus,
        $$\text{Objective Truth (given)} + \text{classical semantics} \implies \text{Existence} \\
        \text{Abstractness} + \text{Independence} \implies \text{Objectiveness}. $$
        Acceptance of the four premises Objective Truth, classical semantics, Abstractness, and Independence is one standard way to justify Objective Existence. <br>
        <br> 
        <br>
        <b>Justifying Objective Truth</b> <br>
        The theorems of mathematics come from a set of axioms, or statements assumed to be true, and rules of inference, or a system of logic. A set of axioms with a set of rules of inference is known as a formal system, and this generates the areas of mathematics. For example, Euclidean geometry has five axioms: <br>
        <br>
            1. A straight line segment can be drawn joining any two points. <br>
            2. Any straight line segment can be extended indefinitely in a straight line. <br>
            3. Given any straight line segment, a circle can be drawn having the segment as radius and one end point as center. <br>
            4. All right angles are congruent. <br>
            5. If two lines are drawn which intersect a third in such a way that the sum of the inner angles on one side is less than two right angles, then the two lines inevitably must intersect each other on that side if extended far enough. <br>
        <br>
        Although Axiom 5, also known as the Parallel Postulate, is much more convoluted than the other axioms, it does not derive from the others and so must be instantiated as an axiom in order to generate Euclidean geometry. However, it turns out that the replacement of it with a slightly different definition of parallelism generates alternative geometries that are both consistent and physically applicable. Therefore, if asked whether the statement "two parallel lines never intersect" is true or false, one could answer that it depends on whether one is drawing those parallel lines on a plane, a sphere, or a saddle; i.e., that it depends on which geometry the statement is being asked within. Thus mathematical statements which seem to be obviously true or false at first pass can have ambiguous truth values because the definition of terms can depend on the formal system.  <br>
        <br>
        To circumvent this, could one instead ask the better-formulated statement "two parallel lines on a plane never intersect," and affirm its truth? There are more problems to consider. Kurt Gödel proved in his infamous incompleteness theorems that (non-rigorously) if a formal system is “powerful” enough to do things like generate a field of mathematics, then it will always have true statements that can not be proven. Consequently, provability of a theorem—that is, derivability of a theorem from the axioms—does not imply truth. An important example of this from set theory is the debate over a conjecture called the Continuum Hypothesis. Although Gödel himself constructed a proof from a standard set of axioms that the Continuum Hypothesis is true, he still thought it was false and that this “only shows that the [accepted axioms of set theory] do not accurately characterize the universe of sets.” Furthermore, Paul Cohen constructed a proof from the same set of axioms that the Continuum Hypothesis was false. Thus the logical basis of mathematical truth is considerably difficult to establish. <br>
        <br>
        On the other hand, perhaps we can establish truth in a different way—namely, via the naturalist view, which says that “any indispensable part of empirical science is likely to be true and therefore something we are justified in believing.” What mathematics is “useful enough,” of course, is up for debate. But, regardless, this standard of Objective Truth cannot be useful for the question at hand. We started from the sublimity of the “unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in physics,” and from there considered if this would imply that mathematical statements have objective truth-values, that is, truth-values independently of whether or not we can have knowledge about them. But the naturalist standard of truth is dependent on that which we can know, and thus does not provide insight into this question. <br>
        <br>
        <br>   

        <b>Conclusion</b><br>
        The sublime experience that derives from the belief in the mathematical nature of the universe seems to me a particularly important one because of its indication of an instinctual belief in mathematics as objective. Mathematics is much more accessible for analysis than, say, noumena or Will-less existence, and I have presented a brief overview on some arguments for and against the objectivity of mathematics. If one believes in the objectivity of mathematics, either via Objective Existence or Objective Truth or both, then this could have implications for dynamically sublime experiences in nature, art, and morality, as well as for the validity of Kant’s and Schopenhauer’s claims about the metaphysical importance of the sublime experience. On the other hand, if one does not believe so, then this would suggest the sublime experience is a purely sensory one, and could motivate the need for a different theory of why the sublime experience arises than the Platonically derived ones that Kant and Schopenhauer provide.
