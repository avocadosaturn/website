    <b>a defense of material substance</b><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <u>I. Introduction</u><br>
    In this paper, I show that Berkeley’s argument that material substance does not exist, where material substance is taken to mean objects which are inactive, have fixed properties, and exist independently of minds, is not strong enough to be accepted. This hinges on the fact that he uses both the variability of perception across one mind as well as across many minds to illustrate the relativity of perception. I argue that the former is not strong enough to reject material substance, and that while the latter is strong enough to do so, it can be interpreted in such a way so as not to necessitate the rejection of material substance, an interpretation which remains a rational conclusion based on common sense. Furthermore, I show that Berkeley has not justified that perception is meaningfully variable across minds in the first place, which invalidates the form of Berkeley’s argument that is strong enough to reject material substance.<br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <u>II. Overview of Berkeley's Argument </u><br>
    In Dialogue I, Berkeley constructs an argument that denies the existence of material substance. He is concerned only with examining the properties of material substance which are immediately perceived by sense, as opposed to merely inferred from sense perception, reasoned about, or simply inaccessible to us. He argues that examination of each sense shows that there is variability in the immediately perceived properties of material substance. To scientific forms of objection, which may say that temperature of a given object is the average velocity of its particles, or that smell is due to the inherent chemical composition of the object, Berkeley can respond in two ways. Firstly, even the primary properties of the most fundamental constituents of material substance, such as the position, velocity, and time of particles, light, physical events, and so forth, are unboundedly variable depending on the reference frame from which one is perceiving it. Secondly, while it is true that scientific theory is grounded in the realm of mathematics and reason, which is not subject to relativity in the same way, any acceptance of a scientific theory comes from experimental verification, and the collection of experimental results is necessarily dependent on sense perception. From this argument, Berkeley draws two conclusions: <br>
    <br>
    (C1) Material substance is variable in its very nature. <br>
    (C2) Material substance cannot exist external to perception.<br>
    <br>
    Examining the validity of the above argument is crucial because its conclusions are the foundation upon which Berkeley constructs all of his other arguments in Dialogues II and III. <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <u>III. Variability of Perception Within One Mind</u><br>
    Berkeley's examination of each of the senses is not homogeneous, in that for some senses he considers the variability of perception within one mind, and for others he considers the variability of perception across many minds. Within one mind, his argument that there is an infinite spectrum of variability with regards to the primary properties of an object, namely extension and motion, holds by the reasons given in section II. <br>
    However, let us consider an object in a vacuum. If one appraised the object at a certain location relative to the object, then left and returned to that location and appraised it once more, one would expect, from experience, that the object would retain its form of extension. Thus even if it is not the case that there is a property of the object that survives all reference frames, it could still be the case that the object's properties are a function of the point in spacetime from which the observer is appraising the object, in the case of the vacuum, or a function of the dynamics of the universe, to generalize. Therefore, when considering only one's own mind, Berkeley is neither justified in concluding (C1) nor (C2). For if an object's properties are a function of spacetime, it is mind-independent, and a separation between object and perception is allowable. <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <u>IV. Variability of Perception Across Minds</u><br>
    If the properties of a given object vary across perceivers, then, purportedly, it is not the case that an object's properties are dependent merely on external spacetime, but rather more strongly on the specific perceiver that is perceiving. Since there is no justification for giving primacy to one perceiver over another, it seems the consideration of many minds allows for the acceptance of (C2). <br>
    I argue that there is a way to account for the variability of objects and retain mind-independent existence, even when considering other minds. This is because it could be the case that, instead of the object of perception being variable by its very nature and each perceptive apparatus being entirely accurate, it is the perceptive apparatuses through which perceivers appraise the object that varies, and the object of perception that is fixed. <br>
    Why would perceptions of an object vary if the object is fixed? One reason could be that all perceptive apparatuses are distorted such that they give an inaccurate representation of the object. In this case, it has no properties that are accessible to perceivers. The only thing one could say one knows about the object is simply that it exists. However, Berkeley believes that it is nonsensical to say that an object with no particular properties exists: “it is a universally received maxim, that everything which exists, is particular.” Then, at least to ordinary perceivers, the object has no knowable properties, and therefore, to ordinary perceivers, the object does not exist. It may be the case that its true properties are accessible to some higher perceiver, but this Berkeley deems beyond our realm of knowledge. 
    Perhaps it could be the case that only some perceptive apparatuses are distorted, and others are reliable. However, since we have no way of knowing the validity of certain perceptive apparatuses over others, Berkeley can rebut this with the same argument as above. <br>
    A stronger argument is that objects of perception are derived from an abstract, purer, and most general form of an object. Then it could be that each perceiver has a reliable perceptive apparatus, but perceives only a particular instance of the pure form of the object. Here it seems that Berkeley can counter once again that everything which exists is particular. And indeed, if there are an infinite number of distinct perceptive apparatuses, which each vary in their perception of an object, then the implication would be that a given object has an infinitude of properties, and such an object cannot exist to us. On the other hand, if there is a finite number of distinct perceptive apparatuses, then it is possible to rule out the properties that a given object does not possess, and thus obtain negative knowledge of the object. This can be done by comparison over all perceptive apparatuses. <br>
    The question of whether there are finite or infinite distinct perceptive apparatuses is not easily resolved. As far as is known to us, there is a finite number of ordinary beings with perceptive apparatuses, which are the beings on planet Earth. One could say that the infinitude of the universe suggests an infinitude of ordinary perceivers, or argue that perhaps rocks, pumpkins, and all other things we usually think of as non-perceiving are actually perceiving. But by Berkeley’s own standard of a reasonable explanation that is not based on premises which are unknowable to us, it is more plausible to accept that there are finite distinct perceptive apparatuses. For if the universe is infinite, by the finitude of ourselves, we cannot know if there are infinite perceivers, and it goes against common sense to assert that rocks and pumpkins perceive. Thus, I have shown that one can defend the existence of abstract, mind-independent objects with fixed properties, even in the face of perceptive relativity.<br>

    <u>V.  Berkeley’s Treatment of Other Minds</u><br>
    In section IV, I have assumed that Berkeley is justified in asserting that other minds have perceptions which are different from one’s own. But In Dialogue I, when Hylas questions Philonous as to whether it is actually the case that objects appear vastly different to different perceivers, Philonous responds, “you may at any time make the experiment, by looking with one eye bare, and the other through a microscope.” This is not a valid justification for the variability of extension across minds, since it puts forward as evidence for it the the variability of extension within one mind. Thus, even taking into consideration Berkeley's microscope example, it is still equally possible that if many perceivers were at the same point in spacetime, they would agree about the primary properties of an object. It then becomes possible to redeem the fundamental constituents of matter, that is, particles and light. And insofar as sense phenomena are understood to be the result of a scientific description of the physical or chemical composition of the object, the weakness of Berkeley’s argument against primary properties is enough to debase his arguments pointing to variability in perception in the cases of distempered palates, animals who eat their own manure, and jaundice. Because Berkeley has not justified that primary properties do not exist independently of minds, separation between object and perception is still tenable.<br>
